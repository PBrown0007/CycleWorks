# CycleWorks

**Tagline**: Your go-to marketplace for buying and selling bicycles.

CycleWorks is a web application designed to connect bike enthusiasts by allowing users to browse, add, and explore bicycle listings with auto-calculated scores based on price and condition. This Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was built entirely solo by Prince Peter Ojezua (GitHub: PBrown0007) as part of my ALX portfolio project. As a beginner software engineering student with no prior experience, I created this from scratch between February and March 2025, hitting an 8/10 progress milestone by Week 2.

## Features
CycleWorks delivers a functional MVP with these core capabilities:
- **Browse Listings**: View a table of bikes with name, price, condition, and score.
- **Detailed View**: Click a bike to see its full details on a dedicated page.
- **Add Listings**: Submit a form to add new bikes to the database.
- **Score Calculation**: Automatically assigns scores:
  - 90: New bikes under $100.
  - 70: Bikes under $200.
  - 50: All others.

These align with the user stories defined in Part 2, ensuring a complete end-to-end user experience.
